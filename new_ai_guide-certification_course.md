AI Guide Certification
Become the bridge between AI and the people who need it most.
Thousands of small business owners are smart, successful, and completely overwhelmed by generative AI. They don't need a tech genius—they need someone patient who can meet them where they are.
That's where you come in.
The AI Guide Certification trains high school students to become effective AI consultants for real local businesses. You already have the tech comfort. We teach you the human skills that make it useful.

Who This Is For
High school students who are:

Comfortable using AI tools like ChatGPT
Interested in gaining real-world consulting experience
Patient enough to help someone who learns slower than them
Looking for a meaningful credential that stands out

No prior professional experience required. Just curiosity, patience, and a willingness to listen more than you talk.

What You'll Learn
This isn't a ChatGPT tutorial—you'll figure that out on your own. This is a consulting and communication course that uses AI as its context.
Understanding Your Client
Why successful professionals freeze around new technology, and how to help them through it without condescension.
Communicating Without Jargon
How to explain AI tools in plain language that builds confidence instead of creating distance.
Finding the Real Problem

The Human Skills
