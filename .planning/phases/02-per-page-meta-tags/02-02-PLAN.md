<objective>
Add React Helmet blocks with unique title, meta description, and canonical URL to all 9 case study pages, 5 product/program pages, 2 legal pages, and the dynamic BlogPost component. Also update blog post excerpts in the data file to meet the 150-160 character requirement. Total: 17 files covering the remaining pages not handled in Plan 02-01.

Purpose: Case studies are high-value pages for demonstrating expertise but currently all show the generic SPA title. Blog posts need dynamic metadata from post data. This plan completes the per-page metadata across the entire site.
Output: 17 files with complete SEO metadata, covering all remaining pages.

    **Update blog post excerpts in src/data/blogPosts.ts:**

    The blog post excerpts are used as meta descriptions via `post.excerpt`. All 5 current excerpts are under 150 characters and must be lengthened to 150-160 characters. Update ONLY the `excerpt` field for each post. Do NOT change any other fields (id, title, author, date, category, tags, image).

    Use these EXACT updated excerpts:

    Post 1 (id: 1) -- update excerpt to (154 chars):
    `"Discover how artificial intelligence technologies can transform your everyday business processes, boost efficiency across departments, and reduce costs."`

    Post 2 (id: 2) -- update excerpt to (157 chars):
    `"Explore how AI and human workers can complement each other to create more efficient, innovative, and productive workplaces for the future of your business."`

    Post 3 (id: 3) -- update excerpt to (156 chars):
    `"Learn how our AI-powered solutions helped a major healthcare provider automate patient intake, streamline daily operations, and cut costs by $2M per year."`

    Post 4 (id: 4) -- update excerpt to (157 chars):
    `"Discover how nonprofit organizations can leverage AI tools to extend their reach, maximize community impact, and do more without straining limited budgets."`

    Post 5 (id: 5) -- update excerpt to (156 chars):
    `"A detailed breakdown of the return on investment your business can expect when implementing AI and automation solutions across key functions and workflows."`

    **Dynamic BlogPost component -- add Helmet using post data with title truncation:**

    **BlogPost.tsx** (`/blog/:id`):
    - Add `import { Helmet } from "react-helmet";` at the top
    - Add `<Helmet>` block AFTER the `if (!post) return <NotFound />;` check (inside the existing `<main>` element, as the first child before `<article>`)
    - Title: Use ` | 10x Velocity` suffix (15 chars including the leading space). To ensure the total title stays under 60 chars, truncate `post.title` to fit: if `post.title.length > 44`, use `post.title.substring(0, 41) + '...'` (44 chars), otherwise use full title. 44 + 15 = 59 chars max.
    - Description: `{post.excerpt}` (use the post's excerpt directly -- now all are 150-160 chars after the data file update above)
    - Canonical: `` {`https://10xvelocity.ai/blog/${post.id}`} ``
    - The Helmet block uses JSX expressions (curly braces) for dynamic values, NOT string literals

    Implementation for BlogPost.tsx:
    ```tsx
    const blogTitle = post.title.length > 44
      ? post.title.substring(0, 41) + '...'
      : post.title;

    // Inside the returned JSX, before <article>:
    <Helmet>
      <title>{`${blogTitle} | 10x Velocity`}</title>
      <meta name="description" content={post.excerpt} />
      <link rel="canonical" href={`https://10xvelocity.ai/blog/${post.id}`} />
    </Helmet>
    ```

    Blog title character counts with truncation and ` | 10x Velocity` suffix:
    - Post 1: "10 Ways AI Can Streamline Your Business Operations" (51 chars) -> truncated to "10 Ways AI Can Streamline Your Busines..." (44) + " | 10x Velocity" (15) = 59 chars
    - Post 2: "The Future of Work: AI and Human Collaboration" (46 chars) -> truncated to "The Future of Work: AI and Human Colla..." (44) + " | 10x Velocity" (15) = 59 chars
    - Post 3: "Case Study: How We Helped a Healthcare Provider Save $2M Annually" (65 chars) -> truncated to "Case Study: How We Helped a Healthcare..." (44) + " | 10x Velocity" (15) = 59 chars
    - Post 4: "Nonprofits and AI: Maximizing Impact with Limited Resources" (59 chars) -> truncated to "Nonprofits and AI: Maximizing Impact w..." (44) + " | 10x Velocity" (15) = 59 chars
    - Post 5: "The ROI of AI Implementation: What to Expect" (44 chars) -> fits without truncation! (44) + " | 10x Velocity" (15) = 59 chars

    IMPORTANT: For BlogPost.tsx, use template literals for title and canonical (they contain dynamic values). For description, use the `content` prop with `{post.excerpt}`.
    IMPORTANT: All canonical URLs use `https://10xvelocity.ai` (NO www, NO trailing slash).
