<objective>
Add React Helmet blocks with unique title, meta description, and canonical URL to all 9 case study pages, 5 product/program pages, 2 legal pages, and the dynamic BlogPost component. Total: 16 files covering the remaining pages not handled in Plan 02-01.

Purpose: Case studies are high-value pages for demonstrating expertise but currently all show the generic SPA title. Blog posts need dynamic metadata from post data. This plan completes the per-page metadata across the entire site.
Output: 16 files with complete SEO metadata, covering all remaining pages.
