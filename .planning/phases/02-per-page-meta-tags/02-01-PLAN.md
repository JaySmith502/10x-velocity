<objective>
Add React Helmet blocks with unique title, meta description, and canonical URL to 12 pages that currently lack metadata, and add canonical tags to the 2 pages (Index, IndustryTools) that already have Helmet from Phase 1. Total: 14 pages.

Purpose: Search engines currently see the generic SPA title "10x Velocity | AI & Automation Consulting" on these pages. Unique metadata enables proper indexing and better SERP click-through rates.
Output: 14 page components with complete SEO metadata (title + description + canonical).

    Run `npm run build` -- build must succeed with no errors.
    Grep all 10 files for `<Helmet>` to confirm each has the block.
    Grep all 10 files for `rel="canonical"` to confirm canonical tags.
    Spot-check 2-3 titles are under 60 characters by counting.

    **Add canonical tag ONLY to existing Helmet blocks (do NOT change title or description):**

    **Index.tsx** (`/`):
    - Add inside existing `<Helmet>`: `<link rel="canonical" href="https://10xvelocity.ai/" />`
    - Note: Root URL gets a trailing slash. This is the ONLY page with a trailing slash canonical.

    **IndustryTools.tsx** (`/industry-tools`):
    - Add inside existing `<Helmet>`: `<link rel="canonical" href="https://10xvelocity.ai/industry-tools" />`

    Same pattern as Task 1. Use fragment wrapper if needed for new pages. For existing pages, just add the `<link>` line inside the existing `<Helmet>` block.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run `npm run build` -- build must succeed.
    Grep Index.tsx for `rel="canonical"` -- should find the canonical link.

    Grep LunchAndLearn.tsx and OnboardingForm.tsx for `<Helmet>` -- should find Helmet blocks.
  </verify>
  <done>LunchAndLearn and OnboardingForm have full Helmet blocks. Index.tsx and IndustryTools.tsx now have canonical tags added to their existing Helmet blocks. All 4 files build without errors.</done>
