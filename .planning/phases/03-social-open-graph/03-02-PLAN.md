<objective>
Add LinkedIn company profile link to the site footer.

Purpose: Provide visitors a direct link to the company's social media presence (SOCL-03). The LinkedIn company page URL (https://www.linkedin.com/company/10x-velocity) was verified during research. This is the only confirmed social profile -- no Facebook, Twitter/X, Instagram, or YouTube accounts were found.

Output: Footer Company column includes a LinkedIn link with icon. SOCL-04 (sameAs schema property) is documented for Phase 4 -- the Organization JSON-LD in Phase 4 plan 04-01 will include `sameAs: ["https://www.linkedin.com/company/10x-velocity"]`.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add LinkedIn link to footer Company column</name>
  <files>src/components/landing/Footer.tsx</files>
  <action>
    1. Add import for the Linkedin icon from lucide-react at the top of Footer.tsx:
       ```tsx
       import { Linkedin } from "lucide-react";
       ```

    2. In the Company column `<ul>`, add a new `<li>` after the address block (the `<li className="text-velocity-muted pb-4">` that contains the Louisville address) and BEFORE the hidden logo `<li>`:
       ```tsx
       <li>
         <a
           href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/10x-velocity"
           target="_blank"
           rel="noopener noreferrer"
           className="text-velocity-muted hover:text-velocity-accent transition-colors inline-flex items-center gap-2"
         >
           <Linkedin className="w-4 h-4" />
           LinkedIn
         </a>
       </li>
       ```

    STYLE RULES:
    - Use the same `text-velocity-muted hover:text-velocity-accent transition-colors` classes as the other footer links
    - Add `inline-flex items-center gap-2` to align the icon with the text
    - Icon size `w-4 h-4` matches common footer icon sizing
    - Must have `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"` (established pattern from Phase 1, decision [01-02])
    - Must use native `<a>` tag, NOT React Router `<Link>` (external URL, decision [01-02])

    NOTE FOR PHASE 4: The verified LinkedIn URL `https://www.linkedin.com/company/10x-velocity` should be included as `sameAs` in the Organization JSON-LD schema. SOCL-04 will be fully satisfied in Phase 4 plan 04-01, not here.
  </action>

    Run `npm run build` to confirm no errors.
    Run `npm run dev`, visit http://localhost:8080, scroll to footer. Confirm:
    - LinkedIn link with icon appears in the Company column after the address
    - Clicking opens https://www.linkedin.com/company/10x-velocity in a new tab
    - Hover state matches other footer links (muted to accent color transition)
    Grep: `grep "linkedin.com/company/10x-velocity" src/components/landing/Footer.tsx` returns the URL.
    Grep: `grep "noopener noreferrer" src/components/landing/Footer.tsx` confirms security attributes.
  </verify>
  <done>
    Footer Company column shows a LinkedIn link with Linkedin icon from lucide-react. The link opens https://www.linkedin.com/company/10x-velocity in a new tab with noopener noreferrer. Visual styling is consistent with existing footer links. Build succeeds.
  </done>
