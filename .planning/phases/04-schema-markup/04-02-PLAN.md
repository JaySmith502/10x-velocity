<objective>
Add Service JSON-LD to the Services index page and all 4 individual service pages, FAQPage JSON-LD to AIWorkshops (existing FAQ data), Services, and PhoneVoiceAgents (new FAQ content authored for schema), and BreadcrumbList JSON-LD to all 5 service-related pages.

Purpose: Helps search engines understand what services the business offers (SCHM-02), provides FAQ structured data for AI-powered search features (SCHM-04), and marks the page hierarchy for service pages (SCHM-03 partial).

Output: All service-related pages have complete schema markup.

  <action>
For each file, add imports and a `script` prop to the existing `<Helmet>` block. Do NOT create a second Helmet block -- add `script={[...]}` to the existing one.

**Imports needed in each file:**
```ts
import { helmetJsonLdProp } from "react-schemaorg";
import { breadcrumbJsonLd } from "@/schemas/breadcrumbs";
```
For files needing Organization reference, also import:
```ts
import { BUSINESS_DATA } from "@/schemas/organization";
```

---

**Services.tsx** (`/services`):

Add `script` prop with 3 JSON-LD blocks:

1. **Service array:** Create a separate `helmetJsonLdProp` call for EACH of the 8 services in the existing `services` array. Extract the service name and description from the existing array data. Each Service JSON-LD should have:
   - `@type`: "Service"
   - `name`: service title from the services array
   - `description`: service description from the services array
   - `provider`: `{ "@type": "Organization", "@id": "https://10xvelocity.ai/#organization" }`
   - `areaServed`: `{ "@type": "Country", "name": "US" }`
   - `serviceType`: "AI Consulting"

   To keep it DRY, map over the services array to generate the helmetJsonLdProp calls:
   ```tsx
   script={[
     ...services.map(svc => helmetJsonLdProp<any>({
       "@context": "https://schema.org",
       "@type": "Service",
       name: svc.title,
       description: svc.description,
       provider: { "@type": "Organization", "@id": "https://10xvelocity.ai/#organization" },
       areaServed: { "@type": "Country", name: "US" },
       serviceType: "AI Consulting",
     })),
     // FAQPage and breadcrumb below
   ]}
   ```

   IMPORTANT: The `services` array in Services.tsx must be defined BEFORE the component function (it likely already is). Verify this before mapping. If it's defined inside the component, that's fine too -- just reference it in the script prop.

2. **FAQPage JSON-LD** for the Services page. Since no FAQ content currently exists on this page, author 4 Q&A pairs relevant to the services offering. These will exist ONLY in the JSON-LD schema for now (visible FAQ UI is deferred to Phase 5 CONT-02). Use questions a potential client would ask:

   ```tsx
   helmetJsonLdProp<any>({
     "@context": "https://schema.org",
     "@type": "FAQPage",
     mainEntity: [
       {
         "@type": "Question",
         name: "What AI and automation services does 10x Velocity offer?",
         acceptedAnswer: {
           "@type": "Answer",
           text: "We offer a comprehensive suite of AI services including process automation, data cleaning, voice agents, smart bots, team training workshops, opportunity discovery, data analytics, and rapid prototype sprints.",
         },
       },
       {
         "@type": "Question",
         name: "How long does it take to see results from AI automation?",
         acceptedAnswer: {
           "@type": "Answer",
           text: "Most clients see measurable results within 30 to 90 days. Our rapid prototype sprints deliver a working prototype in just 10 business days, so you can validate your idea quickly.",
         },
       },
       {
         "@type": "Question",
         name: "Do I need technical expertise to work with 10x Velocity?",
         acceptedAnswer: {
           "@type": "Answer",
           text: "No. We handle the technical implementation and provide training so your team can manage the tools independently. Our workshops are designed for all skill levels.",
         },
       },
       {
         "@type": "Question",
         name: "What industries does 10x Velocity serve?",
         acceptedAnswer: {
           "@type": "Answer",
           text: "We serve businesses and nonprofits across industries including real estate, PR and marketing, government contracting, manufacturing, and professional services. Our solutions adapt to any industry's workflows.",
         },
       },
     ],
   }),
   ```

3. **BreadcrumbList:** `breadcrumbJsonLd([{ name: "Home", path: "/" }, { name: "Services", path: "/services" }])`

---

**DataCleaning.tsx** (`/services/data-cleaning`):

Add `script` prop with 2 JSON-LD blocks:

1. **Service JSON-LD:**
   - `@type`: "Service"
   - `name`: Use the page's H1/title (read the file to get the exact service name)
   - `description`: Use the page's meta description content
   - `provider`: `{ "@type": "Organization", "@id": "https://10xvelocity.ai/#organization" }`
   - `areaServed`: `{ "@type": "Country", "name": "US" }`
   - `serviceType`: "Data Cleaning"

2. **BreadcrumbList:** `breadcrumbJsonLd([{ name: "Home", path: "/" }, { name: "Services", path: "/services" }, { name: "Data Cleaning", path: "/services/data-cleaning" }])`

---

**PhoneVoiceAgents.tsx** (`/services/phone-voice-agents`):

Add `script` prop with 3 JSON-LD blocks:

1. **Service JSON-LD:**
   - `@type`: "Service"
   - `name`: "AI Phone & Voice Agents" (from the page title)
   - `description`: Use the page's meta description
   - `provider`: `{ "@type": "Organization", "@id": "https://10xvelocity.ai/#organization" }`
   - `areaServed`: `{ "@type": "Country", "name": "US" }`
   - `serviceType`: "AI Voice Agents"

2. **FAQPage JSON-LD:** Author 4 Q&A pairs about voice agents (schema-only, no visible UI yet):
   ```tsx
   helmetJsonLdProp<any>({
     "@context": "https://schema.org",
     "@type": "FAQPage",
     mainEntity: [
       {
         "@type": "Question",
         name: "How do AI voice agents handle customer calls?",
         acceptedAnswer: {
           "@type": "Answer",
           text: "Our AI voice agents use natural language processing to understand and respond to callers in real time. They can qualify leads, answer common questions, schedule appointments, and transfer complex calls to your team—all while sounding natural and professional.",
         },
       },
       {
         "@type": "Question",
         name: "Can AI voice agents work with my existing phone system?",
         acceptedAnswer: {
           "@type": "Answer",
           text: "Yes. Our voice agents integrate directly with your existing phone systems and CRM tools, so there is no need to replace your current infrastructure. Setup typically takes just a few days.",
         },
       },
       {
         "@type": "Question",
         name: "What languages do the AI voice agents support?",
         acceptedAnswer: {
           "@type": "Answer",
           text: "Our AI voice agents support multiple languages and can switch between them during a single call. This ensures every caller gets help in their preferred language, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.",
         },
       },
       {
         "@type": "Question",
         name: "How much can AI voice agents reduce my call center costs?",
         acceptedAnswer: {
           "@type": "Answer",
           text: "Most businesses see a 40 to 70 percent reduction in call handling costs. AI voice agents handle routine inquiries automatically, freeing your team to focus on complex, high-value conversations.",
         },
       },
     ],
   }),
   ```

3. **BreadcrumbList:** `breadcrumbJsonLd([{ name: "Home", path: "/" }, { name: "Services", path: "/services" }, { name: "Phone Voice Agents", path: "/services/phone-voice-agents" }])`

---

**AIWorkshops.tsx** (`/services/ai-workshops`):

Add `script` prop with 3 JSON-LD blocks:

1. **Service JSON-LD:**
   - `@type`: "Service"
   - `name`: "AI Workshops for Teams" (from page title)
   - `description`: Use the page's meta description
   - `provider`: `{ "@type": "Organization", "@id": "https://10xvelocity.ai/#organization" }`
   - `areaServed`: `{ "@type": "Country", "name": "US" }`
   - `serviceType`: "AI Training"

2. **FAQPage JSON-LD** using the EXISTING `faqs` array (around line 203-220 in the file). Read the file to find the exact array structure. Map over it:
   ```tsx
   helmetJsonLdProp<any>({
     "@context": "https://schema.org",
     "@type": "FAQPage",
     mainEntity: faqs.map(faq => ({
       "@type": "Question",
       name: faq.question,
       acceptedAnswer: {
         "@type": "Answer",
         text: faq.answer,
       },
     })),
   }),
   ```
   IMPORTANT: Read the actual file to confirm the faqs array variable name and field names (might be `question`/`answer` or `q`/`a` etc.).

3. **BreadcrumbList:** `breadcrumbJsonLd([{ name: "Home", path: "/" }, { name: "Services", path: "/services" }, { name: "AI Workshops", path: "/services/ai-workshops" }])`
