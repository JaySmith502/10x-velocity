<objective>
Add visual breadcrumbs to all remaining interior pages and internal service links to all case studies.

Purpose: CONT-01 requires breadcrumb navigation on ALL interior pages. CONT-04 requires internal service links in case studies. Plan 01 created the VisualBreadcrumb component and applied it to 2 pages; this plan applies it to the remaining ~25 pages and adds case study service links.

Output: Every interior page has a visual breadcrumb trail. Every case study links to at least one relevant service page.

For each page listed below, add two things:
1. Import: `import { VisualBreadcrumb } from "@/components/VisualBreadcrumb";`
2. Render: `<VisualBreadcrumb items={[...]} />` placed right after the opening `<main>` or root container element, BEFORE the hero/title section.

The breadcrumb items array for each page MUST match the existing `breadcrumbJsonLd()` call already in that page's Helmet. Look at the existing `breadcrumbJsonLd([...])` call and use the SAME items array for `<VisualBreadcrumb>`.

**Exact breadcrumb items per page:**

2-item breadcrumbs (Home > Page):
- About.tsx: `[{ name: "Home", path: "/" }, { name: "About", path: "/about" }]`
- Blog.tsx: `[{ name: "Home", path: "/" }, { name: "Blog", path: "/blog" }]`
- CaseStudies.tsx: `[{ name: "Home", path: "/" }, { name: "Case Studies", path: "/case-studies" }]`
- Contact.tsx: `[{ name: "Home", path: "/" }, { name: "Contact", path: "/contact" }]`
- SavingsCalculator.tsx: `[{ name: "Home", path: "/" }, { name: "Savings Calculator", path: "/savings-calculator" }]`
- IndustryTools.tsx: `[{ name: "Home", path: "/" }, { name: "Industry Tools", path: "/industry-tools" }]`
- PowerAutomate.tsx: `[{ name: "Home", path: "/" }, { name: "Power Automate", path: "/power-automate" }]`
- Prototypes.tsx: `[{ name: "Home", path: "/" }, { name: "Prototypes", path: "/prototypes" }]`
- PrivacyPolicy.tsx: `[{ name: "Home", path: "/" }, { name: "Privacy Policy", path: "/privacy-policy" }]`
- TermsOfService.tsx: `[{ name: "Home", path: "/" }, { name: "Terms of Service", path: "/terms-of-service" }]`
- LexiFile.tsx: `[{ name: "Home", path: "/" }, { name: "Lexi-File", path: "/lexi-file" }]`
- OnboardingForm.tsx: `[{ name: "Home", path: "/" }, { name: "Demo", path: "/onboarding" }]`
- SmartBots.tsx: `[{ name: "Home", path: "/" }, { name: "Smart Bots", path: "/smart-bots" }]`

2-item breadcrumbs (nested routes without parent route):
- LunchAndLearn.tsx: `[{ name: "Home", path: "/" }, { name: "Lunch & Learn", path: "/events/lunch-and-learn" }]`
- AIGuideCertification.tsx: `[{ name: "Home", path: "/" }, { name: "AI Guide Certification", path: "/programs/ai-guide-certification" }]`

3-item breadcrumbs (Home > Services > SubService):
- AIWorkshops.tsx: `[{ name: "Home", path: "/" }, { name: "Services", path: "/services" }, { name: "AI Workshops", path: "/services/ai-workshops" }]`
- DataCleaning.tsx: `[{ name: "Home", path: "/" }, { name: "Services", path: "/services" }, { name: "Data Cleaning", path: "/services/data-cleaning" }]`

3-item breadcrumbs (BlogPost -- dynamic):
- BlogPost.tsx: `[{ name: "Home", path: "/" }, { name: "Blog", path: "/blog" }, { name: post.title, path: `/blog/${post.id}` }]` -- note this uses the `post` variable from the existing component logic (the component already looks up the post from blogPosts data). Place the breadcrumb after the `post` variable is resolved but BEFORE the main article content. If the post is not found (early return), do NOT render a breadcrumb.

**Placement rules:**
- Place the `<VisualBreadcrumb>` as the FIRST visible element inside the page's main content wrapper, before any hero section or title
- If the page wraps content in `<main>`, place it right after `<main>`
- If the page wraps content in a `<div>`, place it right after that root div opens
- Do NOT place it inside the `<Helmet>` component
- Do NOT place it before the Fragment/root element

**Pages to SKIP (already have breadcrumbs from Plan 01, or should not have them):**
- Index.tsx (homepage -- no breadcrumb)
- NotFound.tsx (404 page -- no breadcrumb)
- Services.tsx (done in Plan 01)
- PhoneVoiceAgents.tsx (done in Plan 01)
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npm run build` -- no TypeScript errors. Spot check 3-4 pages in dev server to confirm breadcrumbs appear correctly:
- `/about` should show "Home > About"
- `/services/ai-workshops` should show "Home > Services > AI Workshops"
- `/blog` should show "Home > Blog"
- A blog post page should show "Home > Blog > [Post Title]"
  </verify>
  <done>All 18 pages listed above display visual breadcrumbs matching their JSON-LD BreadcrumbList data. Build passes.</done>

For each case study page, add TWO things: visual breadcrumbs and internal service links.

**A. Visual breadcrumbs (all 9 case studies):**

Import `VisualBreadcrumb` and `Link` (Link may already be imported for service links).

Add breadcrumb as the first visible element inside the main content area (before the article/h1).

Breadcrumb items per case study (must match existing `breadcrumbJsonLd()` calls):
- InnesYoung: `[{ name: "Home", path: "/" }, { name: "Case Studies", path: "/case-studies" }, { name: "Innes & Young", path: "/case-studies/innes-young" }]`
- ECatalyst: `[{ name: "Home", path: "/" }, { name: "Case Studies", path: "/case-studies" }, { name: "eCatalyst", path: "/case-studies/ecatalyst" }]`
- HillcrestPartners: `[{ name: "Home", path: "/" }, { name: "Case Studies", path: "/case-studies" }, { name: "Hillcrest Partners", path: "/case-studies/hillcrest-partners" }]`
- CatalystGroup: `[{ name: "Home", path: "/" }, { name: "Case Studies", path: "/case-studies" }, { name: "Catalyst Group", path: "/case-studies/catalyst-group" }]`
- DirectorOfMarketing: `[{ name: "Home", path: "/" }, { name: "Case Studies", path: "/case-studies" }, { name: "Director of Marketing", path: "/case-studies/director-of-marketing" }]`
- BirchwoodRealEstate: `[{ name: "Home", path: "/" }, { name: "Case Studies", path: "/case-studies" }, { name: "Birchwood Real Estate", path: "/case-studies/birchwood-real-estate" }]`
- GovBrokers: `[{ name: "Home", path: "/" }, { name: "Case Studies", path: "/case-studies" }, { name: "GovBrokers", path: "/case-studies/govbrokers" }]`
- Inspyrd: `[{ name: "Home", path: "/" }, { name: "Case Studies", path: "/case-studies" }, { name: "Inspyrd", path: "/case-studies/inspyrd" }]`
- TransportationDirector: `[{ name: "Home", path: "/" }, { name: "Case Studies", path: "/case-studies" }, { name: "Transportation Director", path: "/case-studies/transportation-director" }]`

**B. Internal service links (8 case studies, TransportationDirector already has one):**

Add a contextual paragraph with 1-2 internal `<Link>` elements to related service pages. Place in the "What's Next?" or "Conclusion" section, before the CTA card. Use this styling for links: `className="text-velocity-accent hover:underline"`.

Import `Link` from `react-router-dom` if not already imported.

Service link mapping per case study:

**InnesYoung** -- Add before the CTA "Want to achieve significant results" card:
```tsx
<p className="text-velocity-muted mb-6">
  Discover how our <Link to="/services" className="text-velocity-accent hover:underline">AI process automation services</Link> can transform your operations the way they did for Innes & Young.
</p>
```

**ECatalyst** -- In conclusion/what's next section:
```tsx
<p className="text-velocity-muted mb-6">
  Learn how our <Link to="/services" className="text-velocity-accent hover:underline">AI process automation services</Link> can streamline your workflows and accelerate growth.
</p>
```

**HillcrestPartners** -- In conclusion/what's next section:
```tsx
<p className="text-velocity-muted mb-6">
  Explore our <Link to="/services/data-cleaning" className="text-velocity-accent hover:underline">data cleaning services</Link> and <Link to="/services" className="text-velocity-accent hover:underline">analytics solutions</Link> to consolidate your data the same way.
</p>
```

**CatalystGroup** -- In conclusion/what's next section:
```tsx
<p className="text-velocity-muted mb-6">
  See how our <Link to="/services" className="text-velocity-accent hover:underline">AI automation and analytics services</Link> can accelerate your deal flow and market intelligence.
</p>
```

**DirectorOfMarketing** -- In conclusion/what's next section:
```tsx
<p className="text-velocity-muted mb-6">
  Explore our <Link to="/services" className="text-velocity-accent hover:underline">data analytics services</Link> to optimize your marketing performance with AI-driven insights.
</p>
```

**BirchwoodRealEstate** -- In conclusion/what's next section:
```tsx
<p className="text-velocity-muted mb-6">
  Discover how our <Link to="/services/phone-voice-agents" className="text-velocity-accent hover:underline">AI voice agents</Link> and <Link to="/services" className="text-velocity-accent hover:underline">process automation services</Link> can transform your customer communication.
</p>
```

**GovBrokers** -- In conclusion/what's next section:
```tsx
<p className="text-velocity-muted mb-6">
  Learn how our <Link to="/services" className="text-velocity-accent hover:underline">AI process automation services</Link> can accelerate your proposal workflows and deal management.
</p>
```

**Inspyrd** -- In conclusion/what's next section:
```tsx
<p className="text-velocity-muted mb-6">
  Explore our <Link to="/services/ai-workshops" className="text-velocity-accent hover:underline">AI workshops</Link> and <Link to="/services" className="text-velocity-accent hover:underline">automation services</Link> to supercharge your outreach and data operations.
</p>
```

**TransportationDirector** -- ALREADY has a link to `/power-automate`. Add one additional service link:
```tsx
<p className="text-velocity-muted mb-6">
  See how our <Link to="/services" className="text-velocity-accent hover:underline">full suite of AI services</Link> can drive similar automation wins for your business.
</p>
```
Place this near the existing Power Automate link, in the same section.

**Important:** Each case study page structure varies. Read each file fully before editing. Find the "What's Next?" or "Conclusion" section (most have one) and add the service link paragraph BEFORE the final CTA card (the glass-card with DiscoveryButton). If no such section exists, add it before the last section on the page.
