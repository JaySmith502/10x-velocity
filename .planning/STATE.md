## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: FIX-03 (React Helmet) placed in Phase 1 as foundation -- all per-page meta depends on it
- [Roadmap]: Phases 3 and 4 can run in parallel after Phase 2 (parallelization enabled)
- [Roadmap]: Image optimization grouped with content structure in Phase 5 (not blocking SEO-critical work)
- [01-02]: External URLs must always use native `<a>` tags, never React Router `<Link>`
- [01-02]: Copyright year must always use `new Date().getFullYear()`, never hardcoded
- [01-02]: FIX-02 (LeadConnector form links) requires manual GoHighLevel admin config -- not fixable in code

### Pending Todos

- FIX-02: Update LeadConnector form privacy/terms links in GoHighLevel admin dashboard (Form IDs: mYtM8nnkSBtAzcDroeEO, oF3UAG9Kp3vwDm8QCJ1i)

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
