*(None — single-page milestone)*

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Simple Apps / Rebuilt Nodes tier | Too niche, requires sales conversation first |
| Actual Stripe/payment processing | Using GoHighLevel links, not building checkout |
| A/B testing | Future optimization, not v1.1 |
| Animation/scroll effects | Keep it fast and simple for campaign launch |
