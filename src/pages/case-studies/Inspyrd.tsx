              Inspyrd is a Canadian-based trauma recovery and mental wellness initiative designed to support individuals affected by trauma, including PTSD, first responders, and military reserve components. The organization focuses on structured therapy programs, resilience training, and mental wellness education to empower individuals on their healing journey. As Inspyrd sought to expand into the U.S. market with a pilot program, they encountered strategic and operational challenges that required advanced automation, workflow integration, and AI-driven outreach.

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-velocity-muted space-y-4 ml-4">
              <li>Limited U.S. Market Penetration: Inspyrd lacked a structured plan for reaching first responders and military reserve components in a competitive wellness space.</li>

              <li>Fragmented Operational Workflows: The organization relied on multiple tools for program management, client tracking, and community engagement, leading to inefficiencies.</li>
              <li>Lack of AI-Driven Data Insights: Inspyrd needed data-driven insights to understand PTSD-related trends and optimize program delivery.</li>
              <li>Compliance & Credentialing Challenges: Navigating U.S. mental health and wellness regulations required automation in credential tracking and compliance management.</li>
