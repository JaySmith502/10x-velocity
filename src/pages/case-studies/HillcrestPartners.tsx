              Hillcrest Partners (HCP) is a real estate investment and remodeling firm specializing in flipping, buying/holding, and wholesaling properties. Utilizing a data-driven approach, HCP identifies undervalued properties, renovates them for maximum ROI, and leverages digital marketing to sell quickly and efficiently. However, as the business scaled, operational inefficiencies began to slow down growth and profitability.

              Despite HCP's strong market position, several bottlenecks threatened its ability to scale:

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-velocity-muted space-y-4 ml-4">
              <li>Manual Project Tracking: Disjointed workflows across Trello, FlipperForce, and MLS led to inefficiencies in project management.</li>
              <li>Inconsistent Lead Nurturing: Lack of structured CRM automation (HubSpot) reduced follow-up efficiency for potential sellers and buyers.</li>
              <li>Limited Digital Presence: Social media was underutilized, impacting brand awareness and inbound lead generation.</li>
              <li>Slow Turnaround Times: Renovation projects lacked streamlined oversight, leading to delays in property flips and increased holding costs.</li>
              <li>Data Silos: Critical insights across acquisitions, renovations, and sales were scattered across multiple platforms, limiting strategic decision-making.</li>
