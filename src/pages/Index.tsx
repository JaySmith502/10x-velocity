I don't see the original content of src/pages/Index.tsx in the files you shared, so I cannot determine what code should replace the "keep existing code" comments. I need to see the original Index.tsx file to be able to help you merge the changes correctly while preserving the existing functionality.

Please share the original content of src/pages/Index.tsx and I'll help you update it to remove the duplicate header while keeping all other functionality intact.
